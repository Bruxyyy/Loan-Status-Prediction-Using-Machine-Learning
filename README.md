Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the loan status (approved or not approved) of applicants based on various financial and demographic attributes. Using machine learning algorithms, this notebook demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To analyze and preprocess a dataset of loan applications.
To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict whether a loan will be approved or not.
To optimize the model's performance using hyperparameter tuning.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants, including:

Demographic details: Gender, marital status, dependents, etc.
Financial details: Income, loan amount, credit history, etc.
Loan-specific details: Loan amount term, property area, etc.
The target variable is the loan status, indicating whether a loan was approved (1) or not approved (0).

Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values using imputation techniques for both numerical and categorical data.
Encoded categorical variables using methods like Label Encoding.
Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized the distribution of features using plots (e.g., bar plots, histograms, box plots).
Explored relationships between features and the target variable to identify key predictors.
Addressed class imbalance in the dataset.
3. Model Building
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize the best-performing model.
5. Deployment-Ready Code
Includes a function-based approach to allow for future scalability and deployment.
Key Findings
Credit history and income are significant predictors of loan approval.
Random Forest Classifier provided the best accuracy after hyperparameter tuning.
